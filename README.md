*Pick a random 4 digits number. The digits must be all different. Your goal is to guess the "computer's" number and the computer will give you the number of matches. If the matching digits are in their right positions, they are "bulls", if in different positions, they are "cows".*<br>
***You win once you guess the "computer's number.***
